# **WaterProj as NaviWave**

The aim of the work is to develop a web platform that provides integration and provision of information on offers in the field of water passenger transportation. As part of achieving this goal, the task of aggregating data on current routes, ship schedules, services provided, etc. was solved, which will allow potential passengers to make a more objective choice of a specific route or transport operator. 

The project was developed as part of a thesis (Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University)
